                <h3>Enhance Flexibility and Relieve Tension with Assisted Stretch Therapy</h3>

                <p>At Hexagon Muscle Recovery, we provide Assisted Stretch Therapy—a hands-on stretching technique designed to enhance your 
                mobility, reduce muscle tension, and support your overall recovery. Unlike solo stretching, assisted stretching is guided by a
                trained professional who safely and effectively maneuvers your body to maximize the benefits of each stretch. This method not
                only allows for a deeper stretch but also helps to target muscles and areas that are often difficult to engage alone.</p>
                
                <h3>What is Assisted Stretch Therapy?</h3>
                <p>Assisted Stretch Therapy involves controlled and targeted stretching, led by a skilled practitioner, to improve range of motion,
                flexibility, and muscle performance. By guiding and supporting each movement, assisted stretching ensures proper alignment, 
                reduces the risk of injury, and enhances the effectiveness of each stretch, making it suitable for everyone—from athletes to 
                individuals seeking relief from daily tension and stiffness.</p>
                
                <h3> Benefits of Assisted Stretch Therapy</h3>
